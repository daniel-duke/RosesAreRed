Jane Austen Novel Rankings
==========================

As any civilized soul must, Laura has read all six of Miss Jane Austen's completed novels.
Naturally, she arranged them in order of her esteem and grew curious as to how her judgments aligned with those of the general populace.
Yet no trustworthy information on the matter could be found.
Thus, as any devoted suitor worth his salt would do, Daniel devised a small Python contrivance to extract the necessary figures from a Reddit posting (link provided here__).
For the satisfaction of your own curiosity, the results are set forth below.

Dolbear's Law
=============

Laura and Daniel have gone camping several times now, and have wondered at the local temperature at various times.
As it turns out, this can be determined within a certain degree of accuracy from a simple rule known as Dolbear's Law.
The rule requires one to count the number of crickets chirping in a given time frame, then run that number through a simple equation:

.. math::
   T_F = 40 + N_{15}

where :math:`N_{15}` is the number of cricket chirps in 15 seconds.
Although Laura and Daniel have never verified the accuracy of this correlation, they eagerly look forward to their next opportunity to do so.
