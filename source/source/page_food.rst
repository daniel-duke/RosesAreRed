Marry Me Chicken
================

Did Daniel cook a dish with "marry me" in the name on the first date? Yes, indeed he did. Recipe__.

.. image:: _images/food/240929_marry_me.jpg

.. note::
   Daniel had a few too many things on his mind to take a website-worthy photo of this meal, but the dish was tasty enough to be remade (and adequately photographed) several months later.
   But even that photo is not as pretty as the first attempt at the dish (pictured above), from before Daniel even met Laura (in the flesh, at least).

================
Blueberry Scones
================

Only to be improved by sugar crystals sprinkled on top. Recipe__.

============

The soup that stole Laura's heart. Recipe__.

.. image:: _images/food/250101_chowder.jpg

.. tip::
   Swap out one (or two) of the regular corn cans with creamed corn, and add extra broth to acheive the desired soupiness.

=====================
Roasted Tomato Quiche
=====================

One of four quiches prepared in a single night. Recipe__ (add cayenne to egg mixture and tomatoes on top).

__ https://sallysbakingaddiction.com/cheesy-spinach-quiche/

.. image:: _images/food/250121_quiche.jpg

.. tip::
   Freezing a quiche after baking works perfectly fine, despite online warnings of soggy crusts and overbaking.

=================
Cinnamon Biscuits
=================

Even though these look so delicious, Laura still prefers the good ol' flully plain ones. Recipe__ (for regular ones)

===================
Superbowl Pinwheels
===================

Laura and Daniel, watching a sporting event? Couldn't be. Unless... there's food involved. Recipe__ (cut amount of butter in half).

==============================
Chocolate-Covered Strawberries

=======================
Lemon Artichoke Chicken
=======================

The best meal Daniel has ever made (and the first official 10/10). Recipe__.

__ https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/spinach-and-artichoke-chicken/

.. image:: _images/food/250612_lemon_chicken.jpg

.. note::
   The second attempt at this recipe looked much prettier, and is thus pictured above.
   However, the stress of making it for Laura's parents after a stressful day at work compromised the quality of the meal, sadly.
   It still earned 5-star (and $28 market price) reviews from the parents, but both Laura and Daniel agreed it lacked flavor, likely due to insufficient salt and lemon juice.

============
Baked Salmon
============

Unexpedtedly delicious. Served with hot honey cauliflower, roated potatoes, and (not pictured) homemade Ceasar salad. Recipe__.

.. image:: _images/food/250406_mediterranean.jpg

====================
Japanese BBQ at Home
====================

"Dadiel" tried his darndest, but by the end of the night, meats at all levels of done-ness had been served, from still mooing to charred black. However, there was enough success to warrant another attempt in the not too distant future. Plus, Laura made some nice sauce. Great job Laura!

.. image:: _images/food/250411_cookout.jpg

.. tip::
   When planning a grill night, make sure to start early enough to avoid darkness, and reschedule if the weather looks rainy or dreary.
   Also, when actually grilling, make sure the grill gets good and hot before cooking anything. Oh, and do most of the cooking with the lid closed, but don't leave it closed for too long and forget about it.

=================
Blueberry Muffins
=================

Hailed by Laura's father as possibly the best muffins he has tasted - soft on the inside with a crispy streusel on top. Recipe__.

__ https://www.culinaryhill.com/blueberry-muffins/

.. image:: _images/food/250412_muffins.jpg

.. important::
   Always refrigerate muffins when storing them!

===========
Sumo Orange
===========

Beautifully arranged by a beautiful person. A perfect refreshment after a long afternoon of sanding and mowing.

.. image:: _images/food/250413_sumo_orange.jpg

=================
Tomato Basil Soup
=================

Perfectly balanced sweetness from sugar and acidity from tomatoes, accented fresh oregano from the garden. Recipe__ (Laura and Daniel use campari tomatoes).

==============
Swirly Biscuit
==============

Most of the biscuits were normal, but the swirly one is quite cute and nice, even though the taste suffered. Recipe__

__ https://sugarspunrun.com/easy-homemade-biscuits/

.. image:: _images/food/250607_biscuits.jpg

.. caution::
   Even when someone claims they will never tire of something, they still might do so in due time.

=====================
Tapenade Orzo Chicken
=====================

Hastily thrown together late on a Sunday night, but turned out unexpectedly good! Recipe: inspired by the marry me chicken (here__), but heavily altered (by including tapenade, for instance).

__ https://www.halfbakedharvest.com/pesto-marry-me-chicken-and-orzo/

.. image:: _images/food/250905_tapenade_chicken.jpg

.. note::
   Plate meals photograph better than bowl meals.
   Thus, this pictured dish is a remake from several months later.

============
Kale Ravioli
============

Accented with red onions, apple cider vinegar, butternut squash, and juicy roasted tomatoes. Recipe__.

__ https://www.eatingwell.com/recipe/274005/butternut-squash-ravioli-with-chicken-sausage-kale/

.. image:: _images/food/250613_kale_ravioli.jpg

.. note::
   An astute observer will have noticed several meals with roasted tomatoes.
   This is no conincidence, as roasted tomatoes make Laura very, very happy.

================
Chicken Parmesan
================

From inception to production: 45 min flat. Recipe__.

__ https://www.skinnytaste.com/baked-chicken-parmesan/

.. image:: _images/food/250623_chicken_parm.jpg

.. tip::
   Orzo cannot be beaten.
   Whether baked with pesto, sauteed with sun-dired tomatoes, or simply softened with olive oil, it always comes out delicious.

Macarons
========

Recipe__.

__ https://preppykitchen.com/french-macarons/

.. image:: _images/food/250912_macarons.jpg

.. warning::
   Adding liquid flavor (such as orange or lemon juice) changes the consistency of the batter, resulting in flatarons.
   Also, make sure to sift the almond flour. Oh, and a little bit of butter cream goes a long way.

.. note::
   Despite all the warnings and lessons learned, the flavor is surprisingly easy to hit just right.

Daniel made this meal by himself, for himself, but very inspired by Laura.
